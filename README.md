**Lung Cancer Detection and Segmentation**

This project focuses on automated Lung Cancer Detection and Lung Tumor Segmentation using deep learning. It includes:

1. A classification model to detect cancer vs. normal lung images

2. A U-Net based segmentation model to identify and highlight tumor regions

3. Preprocessing, augmentation, and model training scripts

4. Complete workflow for data loading, training, evaluation, and prediction

This repository aims to support early diagnosis by providing an AI-powered system capable of assisting radiologists and healthcare professionals.
